-- HOW THE GAME WORKS --

1) A jumbled word will be generated in front of the user.

2) The user is supposed to guess that word.

3) If the user enter's wrong guess then the game prompts the user to guess the same word again.

4) If the user Guesses the word then the game produces a new word for the user to guess.

5) WRONG GUESS REDUCES THE PLAYER STRENGTH.

6) RIGHT GUESS INCREASES THE PLAYER STRENGTH. 

7) AS THE PLAYER STRENGTH INCREASES THE DIFFICULTY ALSO INCREASES

8) IF THE PLAYER CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE DIFFICULTY HE/SHE LOSES TO THE GAME.

-- UPCOMING FEATURE --

1) DIFFICULTY LEVEL BASED ON THE PLAYER STRENGTH (PARTIALLY ADDED)

2) SPELLS AND SPECIAL MOVES MAYBE ?

3) PLAYER STATS AFTER THE GAME HAS ENDED

-- COLLABORATORS --

2) Open to more suggestions.
