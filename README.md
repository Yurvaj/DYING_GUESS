-- HOW THE GAME WORKS --


1) THE MAIN MENU HAS THE OPTIONS OF "CLASSIC GAME", "RUTHLESS MODE", "MAGICAL~SHOP","EXIT"
   
- The classic game is a simple game mode for the player to win Gbucks(game currency) in!
- 25 gbucks are won if you maintain the accuracy of [ x > 85% ] & also win the game mode by guessing '25' correct words without dying to the
  increasing difficulty.
- if the player wins the game mode he/she can decide if they want to enter the 'magical~shop' or not
- Hints for the jumbled words are given till the easy mode only, medium and insane mode do not have hints for the jumbled word !
- if the user guesses the wrong word in classic mode then the user will be prompted to guess the same word until the correct word is provided.

2) THE RUTHLESS MODE
   
- This mode is based on the concept of 'double or nothing'; which simply means that if the player guesses the correct word then the users gbucks would be doubled
  but if the user gueses the wrond word then the users gbucks would be become '0'
- A confirmation screen for playing ruthless mode is always generated.

3) MAGICAL~SHOP
   
- As of the release version 'v1.0.4' there is only power availabe to be bought inside of the magical shop, each power cost's '500' gbucks to purchase. That might seem a lot initially but it wont once you start playing 'RUTHLESS MODE'.
- In  the upcoming updates more special abilities will be available !!
