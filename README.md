-- HOW THE GAME WORKS --

-> A jumbled word will be generated in front of the user.
-> The user is supposed to guess that word.
-> If the user enter's wrong guess then the game repeats.
-> If the user Guesses the word then the game produces a new word for the user to guess.

-- UPCOMING FEATURE --

-> DIFFICULTY LEVEL BASED ON THE PLAYER STRENGTH
