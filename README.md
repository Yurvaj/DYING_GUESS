-- HOW THE GAME WORKS --

-> A jumbled word will be generated in front of the user.
-> The user is supposed to guess that word.
-> If the user enter's wrong guess then the game prompts the user to guess the same word again.
-> If the user Guesses the word then the game produces a new word for the user to guess.
-> WRONG GUESS REDUCES THE PLAYER STRENGTH.
-> RIGHT GUESS INCREASES THE PLAYER STRENGTH. 
-> AS THE PLAYER STRENGTH INCREASES THE DIFFICULTY ALSO INCREASES
-> IF THE PLAYER CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE DIFFICULTY HE/SHE LOSES TO THE GAME.

-- UPCOMING FEATURE --

-> DIFFICULTY LEVEL BASED ON THE PLAYER STRENGTH (PARTIALLY ADDED)
-> SPELLS AND SPECIAL MOVES MAYBE ?

-- COLLABORATORS --

-> Collaborated project being worked on by @Zohair & @UV - (Codes)

-> Open to more suggestions.

-- THANK YOU --
